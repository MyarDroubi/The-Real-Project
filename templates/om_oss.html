        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We are a team of two: Myar and Hamid. We study Computer Science and Network Engineering at Högskolan Väst in Trollhättan and share a common passion for technology and digital communication. Our idea for this website was born from a desire to create a place where people can easily ask questions and get answers directly from knowledgeable experts in various subjects. We believe that knowledge exchange and open dialogue are the key to both personal development and technical innovation. By combining our studies with our own experiences, we want to offer a reliable platform where everything from technology-related questions to everyday problems can be discussed in an interactive environment. Our vision is to inspire and make it easier for everyone to learn more, regardless of whether it is about cars, mobile phones, computers or other areas of interest. We are proud to be able to contribute with our expertise and look forward to creating a vibrant community together with you where every question leads to new insights and opportunities.</p>
